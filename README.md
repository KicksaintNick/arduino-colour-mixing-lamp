#The Colour Mixing Lamp
This is a project from my Arduino starter series.

This project comes from the Arduino Starter Kit Projects Book. The project uses photo-resistors to control an RGB LED. This is a great project for beginners. Enjoy!

######Project Requirements
* Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/Diecimila
* USB cable to program Arduino
* Breadboard
* RGB LEDS (Looks like a white LED)
* Three Photoresistors
* Three 220 Ohm Resistors
* Three 10k Resistors
* Wires to power the components on the breadboard

######The Code
As usual I try comment as much of the code as possible. Also be aware that I change the code for the project from what is defined in the Arduino Projects Book. It's not that I don't think the code is good or bad, I just find that there are more interesting ways to tackle these projects and providing an alternative method to approaching this project always leads to better understanding.
